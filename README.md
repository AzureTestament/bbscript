# BBScript - [Download Here](https://github.com/super-continent/bbscript/releases)

## What does this tool do?
This program is made to allow anyone to parse BBScript into a readable (and modifiable) format. It functions through game databases in [RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) format, allowing it to be extended to work with any ArcSys game using BBScript regardless of the differences in functions and their corresponding values. This means it should be able to work with Guilty Gear Xrd, Guilty Gear Strive, Dragon Ball FighterZ, Blazblue Centralfiction, Granblue Fantasy Versus, Persona 4 Arena and more if given the correct data in the form of .ron files.

## How Do I Start Modding?
Depending on the game, there are some guides:
- [Guilty Gear Strive Modding Guide](https://pangaea.neocities.org/post/guilty-gear-strive-modding/)
- [Guilty Gear Xrd](https://github.com/super-continent/bbscript/wiki/Guilty-Gear-Xrd-Modding-Guide)

It's not legally required, but I would greatly appreciate a note giving credit to this project and my other work in any mod READMEs or menus in any mods you make if possible!

## What is BBScript?
BBScript is a script format used by Arc System Works to define functions in their games such as character moves. It's used in most modern ArcSys games such as Blazblue CentralFiction, Guilty Gear Xrd, Dragon Ball FighterZ, and Granblue Fantasy Versus.
